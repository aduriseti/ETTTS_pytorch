        - [x] bigger batch size - gpu mem usge at < 10%
            - [x] might have to increase cores for dataloader - 5 cores about saturates gpu  at batch size 16
            - [x] pretty sure model limited by fetcher speed
        - [x] checkpoint models % training
            - [x] remember to call model.eval() on load chkpt to make sure layers are in evaluation (as opposed to training mode)
            - [x] combine checkpointing logic for text2mel and ssrn by combining the text2Mel,audioDec,attention models into one class
            - save model results also

                - [ ] generated sound
                - [ ] model speed it/sec on cpu and gpu
        - [x] different checkpoint paths for different model params
            - [ ] work smthg out that prevents loading models w/ conflicting hyperparams
            - [ ] automatic cold start i.e. don't have to specify load = 1|0
        - [x] implement model params
            - [ ] nonsep vs sep vs super sep
            - [ ] batch vs layer vs weight vs instance vs group norm
            - [x] alpha
            - [x] learning rate
            - [x] chunk size (1 default for paper)
        - [ ] test out if concatenating mel and text enc makes sense
        - [x] combine the text2Mel,audioDec,attention models into one class
        - [x] generate text2Mel
        - [x] generate SSRN
        - [x] fix inference memory leak
            - with ch.no_grad()
        - [ ] train text2Mel and SSRN together
        - [ ] abstract class/fun for training/checkpointing/loss monitoring
        - [ ] chunked generation - train network to encode multiple timesteps at a time
        - [x] hyperparams class
            - [ ] add initialization?
        - [x] separate training code from model code
        - [x] separate eval code from training code
        - [ ] set behavior at preempt to restart and resume training 
        - [ ] split train test
        - [ ] normalization
            - [x] batch norm
            - [ ] layer norm
            - [ ] instance norm

            - [ ] get idea for learning rate
        - [ ] decay
        - [ ] gradient clipping
        - [ ] pad from other direction? - seemed like attention model trained from end of input to beginning
        - [ ] get rid of unnecesary separability params for separable convolutions
        - [x] get some NULL character going for padding - alternatively modify c2i to not map any character to 0
